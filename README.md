# super-cool-bot-t4t

## what is this?
A Discord bot I'm coding using Python. It's a server bot, currently deployed on Heroku.
This is just for fun and to get more experience coding in Python and asynchronous programming.

## this bot uses:
* [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

## this bot can:
* Quote _The Office_ to users.
* Quote stuff from my friend's YouTube channel [Schopix](https://www.youtube.com/user/Schopix).
* Insult users (only upon request, of course).
* Calmly explain that the [Mokele Mbembe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokele-mbembe) is a myth, and there are definitely not dinosaurs in Africa.
