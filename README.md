# super-cool-bot-t4t

## what is this?
A Discord bot I'm coding using Python. It's a server bot, currently deployed on Heroku.
This is just for fun and to get more experience coding in Python and asynchronous programming.

## this bot uses:
* [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

## this bot can:
* quote The Office to users
* quote stuff from my friend's YouTube channel [Schopix](https://www.youtube.com/user/Schopix)
* insult users
* say hello
* that's pretty much it for now
